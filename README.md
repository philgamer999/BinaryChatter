Ever wanted to chat, but are afraid of third a party reading your chats? This program lets you encrypt and decrypt text messages.
<br>
### Explanation
1. Choose the desired conversion method
2. Type in your text
3. Insert your key
<br> X[index] - deletes a value
<br> -[index][index] - swaps to values (doesn't always work as intended w.i.p.)
<br> _ - reverses the order
<br> O[char] - inserts [char] for 0
<br> I[char] - inserts [char] for 1
<br>
Sample key: X0_OaIb
<br> "Sample" -> "bbaabab baaaabb babbabb aaaabbb aabbabb babaabb"
<br>
<br>

<br> Please excuse the implementation of the conversion. This one works best for future plans.
